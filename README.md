# Heya! 😁

You probably won't see much here :/

## Things about me 😏

I like to program stuff, such as games, apps, and websites! I like to do this stuff for fun because I find it interesting and I like to try new things. Also just so you're aware, don't expect much here because of personal issues. I hope to make cool things someday!
